# Build readme

Hi

Copy all the stuff in a new dir where you want to begin editing a python project.

* start a python shell in the project dir with `nix-shell`.
* then do `cargo new bla-app` in the directory, to create a stock dir.
* add project dependancies in the fresh Cargo.toml in there.
* build with `nix-build`
* voila, see `result` dir..
